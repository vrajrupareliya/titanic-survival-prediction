# 🚢 Titanic Survival Prediction using Machine Learning

Predicting survival chances on the **Titanic dataset** using **Logistic Regression** — one of the most classic beginner projects in machine learning.  
This project demonstrates data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, model building, and evaluation using scikit-learn.

## 📋 Project Overview

The goal of this project is to predict whether a passenger survived or not on the Titanic based on features such as age, sex, passenger class, fare, and family relationships.

We build a **classification model** using **Logistic Regression** and evaluate its performance using accuracy, confusion matrix, classification report, and cross-validation.

## 📂 Dataset

- **Source:** [Kaggle - Titanic: Machine Learning from Disaster](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/data)
- **Files Used:** `train.csv`
- **Target Variable:** `Survived` (1 = Survived, 0 = Did Not Survive)

---

## 🧹 Data Preprocessing

- Handled missing values:
  - `Age` → filled with median  
  - `Embarked` → filled with mode  
  - `Cabin` → dropped (too many missing values)
- Converted categorical variables:
  - `Sex` → numeric encoding (male = 0, female = 1)
  - `Embarked` → one-hot encoding
- Created new engineered features:
  - `FamilySize = SibSp + Parch + 1`
  - `IsAlone = 1 if FamilySize == 1 else 0`
  - `Title` extracted from the passenger’s name (e.g., Mr, Mrs, Miss)
- Scaled numeric features using `StandardScaler`

## 📊 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

A detailed EDA was performed to understand survival patterns:

| Visualization | Insights |
|----------------|-----------|
| 🔹 Survival by Gender | Females had a much higher survival rate |
| 🔹 Survival by Passenger Class | 1st Class passengers had the best survival rate |
| 🔹 Age Distribution | Most passengers were between 20–40 years |
| 🔹 Fare vs. Survival | Higher fare correlated with better survival |
| 🔹 Family Size | Small families had higher survival chances |

Example visualizations:

```python
sns.countplot(x='Sex', hue='Survived', data=df)
sns.boxplot(x='Survived', y='Age', data=df)
sns.heatmap(df.corr(), annot=True, cmap='coolwarm')
```

## 🤖 Model Building

- Model used: Logistic Regression

- from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression
- model = LogisticRegression(max_iter=1000)
- model.fit(X_train, y_train)

## 📈 Model Evaluation

- Hold-out Test Accuracy: `81.0%`

- Confusion Matrix:

- `[[90 15]
[19 55]]`


Classification Report:

| Metric           | Precision | Recall | F1-Score |
| ---------------- | --------- | ------ | -------- |
| Not Survived (0) | 0.83      | 0.86   | 0.84     |
| Survived (1)     | 0.79      | 0.74   | 0.76     |


- 5-Fold Cross Validation Accuracy: `0.791`
